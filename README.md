# Gelatissimo Tips
This code practices OOP with classes in C++. The current business I work at does not offer electronic tips because it doesn't have a way to efficiently distribute the tips to the currently working employees. This program would allow employees to clock in for the duration of their shift, have tips based on user input subtotals allocated to their account, and clocks them out. Program termination is prompted by the user.
